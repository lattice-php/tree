# Lattice Tree

Tree view component for [Lattice](https://github.com/lattice-php/lattice) — hierarchy rendering
from inline nodes, callbacks, or Eloquent adjacency-list sources, with full keyboard navigation
(roving tabindex, typeahead), per-node icons, badges, links, and actions, and lazy child loading
over a signed endpoint. Registered Lattice actions can handle selection and optimistic drag-and-drop
moving without coupling the package to application persistence.

## Installation

```bash
composer require lattice-php/tree
```

That is the whole integration: the package ships its React renderer as source and Lattice's
`lattice()` Vite plugin compiles it into your app's bundle via `virtual:lattice/plugins`. The
PHP classes are picked up by Lattice's discovery and TypeScript generation automatically.

## Usage

```php
use Lattice\Tree\Tree;
use Lattice\Tree\TreeNode;

Tree::make('categories')->nodes([
    TreeNode::make('electronics', 'Electronics')
        ->icon('cpu')
        ->children([
            TreeNode::make('electronics-laptops', 'Laptops'),
            TreeNode::make('electronics-phones', 'Phones')->href('/products/phones'),
        ]),
])->defaultExpanded(['electronics']);
```

Nodes compile their conveniences (`->icon()`, `->badge()`, `->href()`, `->action()`/`->actions()`) into a
canonical body schema of core components — an icon, a text-or-link label, a badge, and an end-floated action
stack. `->badge($label, $color)` accepts any Lattice color.

### Custom node content

For content the conveniences do not cover, `->schema()` replaces the composed body outright:

```php
use Lattice\Lattice\Ui\Components\Avatar;
use Lattice\Lattice\Ui\Components\Badge;
use Lattice\Lattice\Ui\Components\Text;

TreeNode::make('acme-corp', 'Acme Corp')
    ->schema([
        Avatar::make('/avatars/acme.png'),
        Text::make('Acme Corp'),
        Badge::make('Pro')->color('purple'),
    ]);
```

`->schema()` is an escape hatch, not an addition — it replaces the default body entirely. `label` is still
required and keeps driving typeahead and aria announcements even when the schema does not render it. On
Enter/Space, a node without an `href` activates the first button found in its body, so a custom schema should
put its primary action's button first — or expect it to receive Enter.

Or back it with an Eloquent adjacency list (a self-referencing `parent_id` column):

```php
use Lattice\Tree\EloquentTreeSource;

Tree::make('categories')->source(
    EloquentTreeSource::make(Category::class)
        ->orderBy('sort_order')
        ->map(fn (Category $category, TreeNode $node) => $node
            ->badge((string) $category->products_count)
            ->disabled(! $category->is_active)
            ->href(route('categories.show', $category))),
);
```

`->orderBy()` orders roots and every sibling group by that column, followed by the label and ID
for deterministic ties. Without it, label and ID remain the default ordering. The single `->map()`
callback receives the model and its base `TreeNode`, and applies equally to eager and lazy results.

Any other backing store implements the two-method `Lattice\Tree\TreeSource` contract.

## Selection and moving

Attach registered Lattice actions to receive generic interaction payloads:

```php
Tree::use(CategoryTree::class)
    ->activeId(request()->string('category')->toString() ?: null)
    ->selectAction(SelectCategory::class) // { nodeId }
    ->moveAction(MoveCategory::class);    // { nodeId, parentId, position }
```

Clicking a row selects it; expander, link, and node-action clicks keep their own behavior. The active
row updates optimistically and follows later `activeId` props, so a URL parameter can remain the
authoritative selection.

`moveAction()` enables pointer moving between parents and the root. The zero-based `position` is the
node's final sibling position. The client prevents disabled and cyclic drops, rolls back rejected
requests, and offers `Ctrl+Shift+Arrow` keys: Up/Down reorder, Right indents, and Left outdents.
The consuming application owns persistence and authoritative validation; the package never writes a
`sort_order` column itself.

## Lazy loading

Serializing a large hierarchy eagerly is wasteful. Register a tree definition and let expansion
fetch one level per request instead:

```php
use Lattice\Tree\AsTree;
use Lattice\Tree\EloquentTreeSource;
use Lattice\Tree\TreeDefinition;
use Lattice\Tree\TreeSource;

#[AsTree('categories')]
class CategoryTree extends TreeDefinition
{
    public function source(): TreeSource
    {
        return EloquentTreeSource::make(Category::class);
    }
}
```

```php
Tree::use(CategoryTree::class)->lazy();     // roots eager, deeper levels fetched on expand
Tree::use(CategoryTree::class)->lazy(2);    // two levels eager
Tree::use(CategoryTree::class)->lazy(0);    // bare skeleton — even the roots are fetched
```

Passing `->activeId($id)` to an Eloquent-backed tree resolves that node's ancestors, then loads,
expands, and focuses the node through lazy levels. Custom `TreeSource` implementations return the
ancestor IDs from `path()`. After a mutation, change `->revision($key)` to discard cached lazy children
and refetch expanded branches while preserving active and focus state.

The definition is discovered like any Lattice definition (`#[AsTree]` + Lattice's discovery
paths), and the serialized tree carries a sealed reference — the same signing machinery Lattice
tables use — that the package's `lattice/trees/{tree}` endpoint verifies before resolving the
definition again with the identical context. `authorize()` on the definition gates both the
initial render and every fetch. The route's middleware and path follow Lattice's group
conventions: `config('lattice.trees.middleware', ['web', 'auth'])` and
`config('lattice.trees.endpoint', 'lattice/trees/{tree}')`.

An `EloquentTreeSource` behind the endpoint automatically switches to per-level queries
(`WHERE parent_id = ?` plus a scoped `EXISTS` probe for `hasChildren`) instead of loading the
whole table. Inline `->nodes()` / `->source()` trees stay eager-only — without a registry key
there is nothing to seal — so `->lazy()` on them throws.

## Translations

The component's strings ship with inline English defaults. With
[bambamboole/laravel-i18next](https://github.com/bambamboole/laravel-i18next) enabled, the
plugin's `tree` namespace is loaded automatically and serves
the bundled `en`/`de` translations (override them like any Laravel package translation).

## Development

```bash
composer install && npm install
composer check          # pint --test, phpstan, pest (Unit + Feature)
npm run typecheck && npm test
composer test:browser   # rebuilds the workbench bundle, then runs the Playwright suite
composer serve          # workbench demo app: /tree (eager) and /tree-lazy (lazy endpoint)
```
